# SignNet Installation and Usage Guide

Back-End -> Where the training and the testing takes place. All Python code.
Front-End -> Where the design of the website takes place. All React.js code.

## Prerequisites
Before installing SignNet, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:
- Python 3.8 or newer
- pip (Python package installer)
- A webcam for real-time gesture recognition

## Installation

### 1. Get the files ready
All the files are provided on the zip file attached to the submission link. Compress the files and put them in a python environment.

### 2. Install Required Packages
Make sure to install every required library for the code to run.
These libraries can be found on the top of each file before you try to run it.

## Configuration
Ensure your webcam is properly configured and accessible by your operating system for real-time video capture.

## Running SignNet

### Starting the Application
To start the application, run the following files:
  Back-End: run app.py
  Front-End: write "npm start" in the terminal

To make your own personalized model, run these files in order:
  collect_images.py
  create_dataset.py
  train_random_forest.py
  interface_classifier.py or app.py

To run the Back-End only without the design from the website, run the interface_classifier.py.

### Using the Application
1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
2. Grant the necessary permissions for the application to access your webcam.
3. Start performing sign language gestures in front of the webcam. The recognized gestures will be displayed in real-time on the web page.

### Common Issues
- **Webcam Access Denied**: Ensure that your browser has the necessary permissions to access the webcam.
- **Dependency Errors**: If you encounter errors related to missing packages, check the libraries being used on each file again.
